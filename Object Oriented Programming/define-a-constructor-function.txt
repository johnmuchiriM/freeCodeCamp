// Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

// Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
// Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
// Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.
